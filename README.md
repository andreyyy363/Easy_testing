# Easy Testing

## Description

Easy Testing is a platform designed for automated knowledge assessment of students through tests in various subjects. It allows teachers to create question banks for each subject and configure tests that are generated randomly, ensuring that each student receives a unique set of questions. The system enables selecting a specific number of random questions (e.g., 40 out of 100) for each test, providing a fair and efficient evaluation process.
